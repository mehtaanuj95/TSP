## Version 2.0
This version solves TSP using genetic algo. 

- [x] Source fixed
- [x] Cyclic order taken into account

*note:* This version differs from v2.0 in sense that in this version, the initial order does nt contain the source. TO account for source, its cost has been added in the fitness function.
